# Personal Portfolio Website Code, now with CSS
## Programmed by Benjamin Greenberg
Mini Project for Coding Temple

___
## Project Overview
This project adds on to my understanding of Hypertext Markup Language \(HTML\) by using CSS to style my personal portfolio webpage. My website adds on to my existing HTML portfolio, implementing more user friendly type face and styling. It also implements creative hover and focus effects through psuedoclasses, and makes it more engaging through implementation of various keyframe animations and transitions. My website also now uses responsive development practices by using CSS to rearrange my content vertically when our user uses a smaller device.
